I started by separating order requests from product inquiries.\n","2.  I simplified and extracted key information from messages, focusing on essential data such as product ID, name, and quantity.

After receiving responses in a specific format, I converted them into columns for further processing, including product ID, name, or, if both were missing, the original message.\n","4. I used advanced regex matching and other techniques to ensure that orders were correctly associated with product logs. I also updated the product log accordingly.\n","5.  When an order request lacked specific details like the name or product ID, I attempted to match those orders to other fields and descriptions. If enough details were found, the orders were processed.
